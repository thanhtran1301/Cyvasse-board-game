Final Project for CSC 211
-------------------------------------------------------------

Copy all of the .java files in this directory as the starting 
place for the final project. 

Gameboard.java contains the main method that runs the code.

You can also use the setupCustomBoard method in Gameboard to 
setup the terrain and players directly, instead of having the 
user do this at runtime.  

Start by familiarizing yourself with the structure of the code, 
including the Board, Square, and Piece classes.  The graphics 
are handled in Gameboard, and you shouldn't need to modify 
that code to get the game working.  

You will primarily change the code in the classes for each 
piece.  Each piece (Rabble, Elephant, Catapult, etc.) inherits 
from the Piece class.
